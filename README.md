# My Survey Builder
I developed a customized survey builder with score for each question from basic Form IO.  I inspired from Survey Builder from surveyjs
In Formio there is a inbuilt Survey component, i customized it to accept scores, percentage for options, adding comments etc.
and I re configured the fieldgroup component to act as a question group. where you can group multiple survey component in an single group.

Currently i am working on to restrict fieldgroup inside fieldgroup.
